                I'm a passionate front-end developer focused on crafting
                responsive websites and intuitive web applications that solve
                real-world problems. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, I bring ideas to life through clean code, thoughtful
                design, and a commitment to accessibility.
                My mission is to make technology more inclusive—building digital
                experiences that are usable by everyone, regardless of device or
                ability. I’m actively and continuously seeking opportunities to
                learn, collaborate, and grow.
                Recently, I built a dynamic recipe page using semantic HTML and
                styled it with modern CSS techniques. It features interactive
                ingredient lists, designed with accessibility and mobile
                responsiveness in mind.
